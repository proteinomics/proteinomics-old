### Data sources

In order to keep all content current with official data sources, proteinomics.org strives to only include data accessible by API. If you are the owner or manager of a data set that is not accessible via API but you think it belongs on proteinomics.org, please send a message.

Most data on proteinomics.org come from the from the following sources:

* [FAOSTAT](https://www.fao.org/faostat) - The statistics portal of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations

* [USDA NASS](https://www.nass.usda.gov/) - The United States Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service

* [UN Comtrade](https://comtrade.un.org/) - Repository of official international trade statistics

* [BLS](https://www.bls.gov/) - United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (consumer price data via rdbnomics)

* [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) - Free API access to public market data

* Fred

* WDI

* [FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/) - Data on nutritional composition of foods provided by the USDA's Agricultural Research Service

Charts on proteinomics.org containing data from sources other than the above will include source details in the chart caption. 

### Learning resources

proteinomics.org could not have been built without the well-documented work of these individuals:

* [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/en/), [Amber Thomas](https://amber.rbind.io/), and [Alison Presmanes Hill](https://www.apreshill.com/) - heros of data visualization and visual storytelling. They are also the authors of the documentation for [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), the R package used to build proteinomics.org. 

* [Joshua Kunst](https://jkunst.com/) - developer and maintainer of the [highcharter](https://jkunst.com/highcharter/index.html) package for R, and author of many well-documented example cases, without which proteinomics.org would be at a significant loss. 

### Software, tools, technologies and services

* [R and RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) - the software with which proteinomics.org was built

* [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) - enterprise charting library free for noncommercial use

* [Github](https://github.com/) - hosting the proteinomics.org files from which the website is built, and providing access to the global community of experts and open-source enthusiasts

* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) - continuous deployment and hosting of the proteinomics.org public website

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - the static site generator. proteinomics.org is built with the Hugo [Doks](https://github.com/h-enk/doks) theme by [@h-enk](https://github.com/h-enk)

proteinomics.org is hosted for free as a static website. However, its data functions are performed in R on a private server managed by Protein Report.
